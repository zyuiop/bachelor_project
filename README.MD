# Engine

A Computer Science undergraduate project, written in spring 2019.

## Goals

The project focuses on building a game in which the main character, the player, can control other characters, to change
their timeline.

## Compile and run

To run the project, use `sbt runMain ch.epfl.lara.engine.game.GameGUI` for the GUI version or `sbt runMain ch.epfl.lara.engine.game.GameCLI` for the terminal version.

## More information

All the information about playing the game, creating games, and the way the engine works, can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/zyuiop/bachelor_project/wiki)

# Acknowledgements

This project was built using the _Scala_ language. It relies on the [Scala Parser Combinators](https://github.com/scala/scala-parser-combinators) library to parse the levels and programs. It uses [ScalaFX](http://www.scalafx.org) for the GUI.

Special thanks to [Pr. Viktor Kuncak](http://lara.epfl.ch/~kuncak/) from the [Lab for Automated Reasoning and Analysis](http://lara.epfl.ch/) for offring me to work on this project and keeping track of my progress along the way.
