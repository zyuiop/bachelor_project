# Engine

A Computer Science undergraduate project, written in spring 2019.

## Goals

The project focuses on building a game in which the main character, the player, can control other characters, to change
their timeline.

## Compile and run

To run the project, use `sbt runMain ch.epfl.lara.engine.game.GameGUI` for the GUI version or `sbt runMain ch.epfl.lara.engine.game.GameCLI` for the terminal version.

## More information

All the information about playing the game, creating games, and the way the engine works, can be found on the [Wiki](https://github.com/zyuiop/bachelor_project/wiki)
